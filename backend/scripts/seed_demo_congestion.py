scripts/seed_demo_congestion.py

Seeds peak-hour congestion samples on real segments departing every stop
listed in data/stop_congestion_scores.csv -- a manifest of real, measured
Kathmandu congestion severity (source: data/congestion_loss_table.csv, a
91-location traffic study) matched against this project's actual stops,
plus a small number of stops not covered by that study (marked
"fallback_average" in the manifest -- see there for exactly which ones
and why), so avoid_congestion=true on /route-finder has real data to
route around instead of an empty table.

For each stop in the manifest, this DISCOVERS a real departing segment at
runtime from the live routing graph (the longest "ride" edge leaving that
physical stop, across any route serving it) rather than a hardcoded list
-- so this script keeps working as routes/stops data changes, and scales
to however many stops the manifest covers without hand-picking each one.
A small OVERRIDE_SEGMENTS table below takes precedence for the couple of
stops where a specific segment (not just "the longest edge") is known to
produce a visible reroute -- see its own docstring.

This seeds the ORGANIC, per-(route, segment) congestion mechanism (see
app/db/queries.py's record_congestion_sample). There's a second,
independent mechanism too -- geographic congestion ZONES (see
app/routing/congestion_zones.py), which apply to any route passing near a
real congested point regardless of which route it is, and need no
seeding step at all (they load straight from data/congestion_zones.csv
whenever avoid_congestion=true is used). Both are combined in
pathfinder.py's weight function -- see its docstring for how. This script
demonstrates the organic mechanism specifically; see
docs/congestion-demo.md for a worked example of both.

Run:
    python -m scripts.seed_demo_congestion

Safe to re-run: each call just re-records another sample into the same
(day_of_week, hour_bucket) via the normal EMA blend in
queries.record_congestion_sample, it doesn't duplicate rows.

#   R-SAJHA-01 hop is the one Maitighar->Gongabu Bus Park traffic actually
#   rides through. Congesting it triggers a reroute via a different
#   feeder route, since R-SAJHA-01 is the only route serving Gongabu Bus
#   Park at all.
