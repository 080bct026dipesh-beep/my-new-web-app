"""
api/congestion.py

GET /congestion — historical congestion stats for a given day-of-week /
hour-bucket, defaulting to "right now" in Nepal time.

Data comes from segment_congestion_stats, an aggregate table upserted by
api/routing.py on real traffic (see _record_leg_congestion) and optionally
pre-populated by scripts/seed_congestion_stats.py. This endpoint is pure
read: it classifies each row's congestion_ratio into a CongestionLevel and
returns it, no writes.
